# Dental Clinic Telegram Bot

## Project Idea
The goal of this project is to create a Telegram bot that acts as a virtual assistant for a network of dental clinics. The bot will provide users with information about the clinics, services, and specialists, help them schedule appointments, and facilitate direct contact with the clinics. This will streamline customer service, reduce the workload on clinic staff, and provide users with quick and easy access to necessary information.
